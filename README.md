# Date in Pi Finder
A fun little module for finding a date in Ï€.

Uses variations of the date as well as searching for both American and European date formats.

Most notably, run `findTodayInPi()` to search for todays(UTC) date within pi.

[`pidatefinder.py`](https://github.com/KeelyHill/Date-in-Pi-Finder/blob/master/pidatefinder.py) is where the code is located.
